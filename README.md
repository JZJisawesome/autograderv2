We're doing a sequel!

## Updates about Lab 3

Just a heads up: for Lab 3 the spec has changed enough that
several Lab 1 and 2 tests *are no longer expected to pass*.

Therefore **please use `main3.c` for testing your Lab 3 code**.

Good luck on the final few deliverables and on exams!

Cheers and all the best!
